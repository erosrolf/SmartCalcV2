## Calculator<br>

### Overview<br>
This project is an advanced calculator capable of evaluating bracketed expressions with trigonometric functions using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). It also features a function graph plotting capability. The core calculation logic is implemented using a custom-built C++17 library, and the application is developed using the Avalonia framework. To keep track of operation history, the application stores data in an SQLite database.<br>

### Features
1. Expression Evaluation: Accurately calculates complex mathematical expressions, including those with parentheses and trigonometric functions, using Reverse Polish Notation.<br>
1. Graph Plotting: Visualizes mathematical functions through intuitive graph plotting.<br>
1. Core Library: Utilizes a core library written in C++17 for high-performance calculations.<br>
1. User Interface: Built with the Avalonia framework, ensuring a modern and responsive user interface.<br>
1. History Tracking: Stores the history of calculations in an SQLite database for easy access and review.<br>
1. A complete list of operations and functions can be viewed in the running program by going to Info.<br>

### Technologies Used
- C++17: High-performance core laclulation library.
- Avalonia: Cross-platform UI framework for constructing the graphical user interface.
- SQLite: Lightweight datebase for storing calculation history.
